Walking out of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, my head's a blender full of chase scenes, rough landings, and Tom Cruise's everlasting face of destiny-defying intensity. Seriously, I was half expecting my popcorn to become a secret device in the plot, that's how wild it gets. It's like they packed all seven of the previous films into one and then forgot to tell the editor Hey, maybe slow down a bit.

So, yeah, I'll admit, I'm kind of amazed that my legs are still working after gripping my seat so hard. You ever feel those seats in a theater hug your butt like they're trying to keep you safe from the insanity on screen? That's where I was, right in the middle of this hurricane of explosions and espionage. There's a moment—I won’t spoil it, but let’s just say parachuting from a building that’s ALSO shrinking in size. Explain that, physics! Can't, but Mission: Implausible doesn't care.

> Oh, and the plot! Let’s talk about how it's like trying to follow someone’s phone conversation when you can only hear their side of things. It’s tricky, feels illegal, and you sort of understand... until you don't. Final Reckoning they called this? More like 'Impossible to Reckon' for my brain cells. But hey, the gadgets—man, they left me wanting to download the movie just to freeze-frame those scenes and geek out properly later. Whoever's in charge of spy gadgets in this universe deserves a medal for nonsense creativity.

I'm sort of in awe of Cruise. Like does he age with the rest of us or come from a future where people live forever and drive motorbikes backwards in time? Either way, can't deny the man knows how to run and look good while doing it. Sure, I'm a tad worn out by the formula, but there's this insane comfort? Like sipping a drink you know too well, yet it's still deliciously aggressive. Watching the movie felt mandatory and thrilling at the same time, like the movie equivalent of skydiving.

  return file.split('').reverse().join('');
}

Anyway, final thoughts, or whatever's left of them after having them blown to smithereens; should you see it? If you're a fan of having your eyebrow nearly jump off your forehead, then yes, run, don’t walk—just not like Cruise because that's a competitive sport. If not, well, maybe save it for a rainy day when overstimulation feels like the right kind of wrong? Men's shoes come in sizes; Mission: Impossible movies don't—they’re always over the top, like a hotdog with way too much mustard but still irresistibly worth a bite.
